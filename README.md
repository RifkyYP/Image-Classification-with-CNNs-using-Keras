# Image-Classification-with-CNNs-using-Keras
Implementation of Image Classification with CNNs using Keras Project by Coursera Projected Network

This Project shows you how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, and you will learn to train CNNs to solve Image Classification problems. In this project, we will create and train a CNN model on a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.
